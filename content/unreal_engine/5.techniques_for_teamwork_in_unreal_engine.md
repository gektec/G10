## 5.1 Importance and Requirements of Teamwork in Unreal Engine
Teamwork is very important in the development of Unreal Engine. A good Unreal Engine production team usually has: a project manager with good communication skills, an innovative set designer, a good 3D modeler, a technical artist who knows the UE material editor, an engineer who knows how to operate Unreal Engine, and a conscientious tester. Only the cooperation of the team will prevent the project from stalling for any reason.

### Dividing Teamwork in an Unreal Engine Project
In an Unreal Engine project for virtual production, there are different tasks to handle; therefore, it is not necessary for every team member to build virtual environments in Unreal Engine. In our project, our team initially needs to build two virtual environments, so tasks are divided into finding suitable models or assets, modifying or customizing the assets in Unreal Engine or Blender, and constructing the virtual environments using the assets.

## 5.2 Version Control Solutions
This section provides an introduction to version control solutions and version control systems (VCS), explaining the characteristics of Unreal Engine projects.

### Introduction
A Version Control Solution in this context refers to an integrated solution for version control and synchronization of Unreal Engine projects. It can be separated into two components: the version control system and a server with storage to host central or remote repositories where your Unreal Engine projects are stored. A version control system is a software system that provides synchronization and version control of project files.

### Characteristics of Unreal Engine Projects
- **Large file sizes**  
  An Unreal Engine project often contains many large files, such as 3D models and high-resolution textures. The initial size of a project may not require much storage, but as the project grows, it will need more space measured in gigabytes.

- **Diverse file types**  
  An Unreal Engine project typically contains different types of files, many of which are binary files.

#### How these Characteristics Affect the Choice of Version Control System
It is possible that a version control system may not manage large files and binaries effectively. For example, Git itself does not handle large binaries well, but the Git extension Git LFS (Large File Storage) addresses this issue.

### Version Control Systems
#### Categories of Version Control Systems
There are mainly three types of version control systems:
1. **Centralized Version Control Systems**
   - Centralized systems, such as Perforce Helix Core, use a single server to store all versions of project files and corresponding changes. This central server stores every version of project files as the main repository.
  
2. **Distributed Version Control Systems**
   - Distributed systems, like Git, save the project files in a main repository. Each collaborator has a local version on their own computer checked out from the remote repository, allowing them to modify files offline before committing changes and pushing them back to the remote server.
  
3. **Local Version Control Systems**
   - Local systems are primarily for solo developers rather than virtual production teams.

### Possible Version Control Systems for Unreal Engine Projects
This section references Unreal Engine documentation [(link)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/collaboration-and-version-control-in-unreal-engine), which introduces methods that enable version control with Unreal Engine. Three version control systems are discussed:
- **Perforce**
- **Subversion (SVN)**
- **Diversion**

Among these, Perforce and Subversion are fully integrated with Unreal Engine, supported by built-in source control features. Diversion provides plug-ins or tools for integration with Unreal Engine. For more details, please refer to the provided link.

#### P4 (Helix Core or Perforce)
P4 [(link)](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core) is a version control platform used in the industry for game development. It is a centralized version control system, known as "Helix Core" or "Perforce." It is utilized internally by Epic Games and stakeholders in our project. While it is commercial software, it allows free use for small teams of up to 5 users without providing hosting services.

#### Subversion
Subversion [(link)](https://subversion.apache.org/) is an open-source centralized version control system under the Apache License, Version 2.0 [(link)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

#### Diversion
Diversion [(link)](https://www.diversion.dev/) is a cloud-based version control system.

#### Git with Git LFS
Git [(link)](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system, open source under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 [(link)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0). Git LFS [(link)](https://git-lfs.com/) is an open-source Git extension that helps manage binary files and large files.

### Version Control Service
This section analyzes the pricing of version control systems discussed previously to find a suitable option for a student group. The pricing information may change in the future; please always visit the respective website links provided.

#### Paid Version Control Service
- **Perforce**
  - Perforce does not provide hosting services for users on the free plan. If you are on the free plan, you will need to find a cloud service or host the service yourself.

- **Subversion**
  - Since Subversion is open source, you will also need to host the service yourself or find a cloud service.

#### Free Version Control Service for Small Teams or Educational Purposes
- **Diversion for Educational Use**
  - Diversion is commercial software but offers free use for educational users, allowing up to 100 GB and up to 10 users in a repository. A user is categorized in the Educational tier upon registration, verified at the time of writing this documentation. This is beneficial for a student group or small team wanting to try virtual production at no cost.

- **Git with Git LFS**
  - Similarly to Subversion, you will need to find a cloud hosting service or platform that supports Git and Git LFS. Both GitHub and GitLab are cloud-based platforms typically used for hosting code repositories. With Git LFS, every GitHub account on the free tier has 1 GiB of free storage and 1 GiB of free bandwidth monthly, and every GitLab project has 10 GiB for free. However, Git can be difficult for students and creators without prior experience, making it potentially unsuitable in Virtual Production.
