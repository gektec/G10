In the forefront of today's film and television Production, **Virtual Production** is gradually becoming a key force to promote industry change. Virtual production is an innovative film and television production technology that deeply integrates traditional shooting methods with advanced digital technology. It uses techniques such as **real-time rendering** and **motion capture** to create realistic scenes, characters, and special effects within a virtual environment. This content is then presented in real time on the shooting scene, allowing creators to *adjust and optimize* their content on the fly, which greatly improves the flexibility and efficiency of the creative process.

Our projects focus on virtual production and motion capture filmmaking. After several in-depth meetings with stakeholders, we decided on a project direction that uses the game engine to create **two virtual scenes** specifically for film production. These virtual scenes fully leverage the advantages of virtual production, offering a highly flexible and realistic environment for film shooting.

Key points about our project:
- We will primarily use the game engine **Unreal Engine 5.3**.
- In the following OER chapters, we will cover **installation and usage of Unreal Engine**.
- Developing a virtual environment mainly involves importing virtual assets into the game engine.
- Users can create their own virtual assets using modeling software (we used **Blender**, but you can choose any software you're comfortable with). Alternatively, you can find 3D models onlineâ€”just be cautious about **copyright issues** (see chapter 2.4.1 of the OER for more details on licenses).
- We also utilize several plugins to streamline our workflow, including **Fab**, **Twinmotion**, and **Datasmith**.

This framework will not only enhance the creative process but also ensure a **highly efficient** production environment that takes full advantage of modern virtual production techniques.
