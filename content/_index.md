In the forefront of today's film and television Production, Virtual Production is gradually becoming a key force to promote industry change. Virtual production is an innovative film and television production technology, which deeply integrates traditional film and television shooting with advanced digital technology. Through real-time rendering, motion capture and other technical means, realistic scenes, characters and special effects are created in the virtual environment, and can be presented in real time on the shooting scene, so that creators can adjust and optimize the shooting content in real time. Greatly improve the flexibility and efficiency of creation.

Our projects focus on virtual production and motion capture filmmaking. After many in-depth meetings with stakeholders, we decided on a project direction to use the game engine to create two virtual scenes for them, specifically for the film. These virtual scenes will give full play to the advantages of virtual production, providing a highly flexible and realistic virtual environment for film shooting.

In our project, we will mainly use the game engine of Unreal 5.3 version. In the following OER chapters, we will teach you how to install and use Unreal Engine first. To develop a Virtual Environment, the most important thing is to put virtual assets into the game engine. Of course, the users can create the virtual assets by themselves, using some modeling software. In our project, we used blender, but users can choose any modeling software as you like. Also, you can just find some 3d modeling on the internet as your virtual assets. But beware of copyright issues. You can refer to chapter 2.4.1 of the OER for more knowledge of the licenses. Moreover, we also used some plugins to help us. For example, Fab, Twinmotion, and Datasmith. We will talk more about them later.
